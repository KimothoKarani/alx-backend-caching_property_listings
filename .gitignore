# Docker-related (if building images and local volumes)
# If you have specific build artifacts or local volumes that shouldn't be committed
# For example, if Docker creates local mount points that you don't want to track
# You generally commit docker-compose.yml itself, but ignore generated data.
# Often, you don't need to add much here unless you have specific volumes.
